## Technologies
Project is created with the following :

#### Languages
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

#### Software
* VS Code
* Figma

#### Hosting Service

## Limitations/Problems encountered
#### Dropdown menus in navbar not loading as expected.
* Can be resolved with rewriting the code for navbar, adding more specificity through selectors in custom CSS or using a Bootstrap navbar instead.

#### Bootstrap CSS used for Carousel overriding user's custom CSS leading to font & alignment errors.
* Can be resolved using higher precedence selectors for a given element so that Bootstrap's CSS is overriden by our custom CSS.
* For this task, I used a separate HTML file (all included in a separate folder CarouselFiles) to just design and use the carousel component through Bootstrap 4, recorded it as a video element and put it in the original web page.
